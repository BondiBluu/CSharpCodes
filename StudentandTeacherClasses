/*Create a new project, and include in it the class Person that you just created.

Create a class "Student" and another class "Teacher", both descendants of "Person".

The class "Student" will have a public method "GoToClasses", which will write on screen "Iâ€™m going to class."

The class "Teacher" will have a public method "Explain", which will show on screen "Explanation begins". Also, it will have a private attribute "subject", a string.

The class Person must have a method "SetAge (int n)" which will indicate the value of their age (eg, 20 years old).

The student will have a public method "ShowAge" which will write on the screen "My age is: 20 years old" (or the corresponding number).

You must create another test class called "StudentAndTeacherTest" that will contain "Main" and:

Create a Person and make it say hello

Create a student, set his age to 21, tell him to Greet and display his age

Create a teacher, 30 years old, ask him to say hello and then explain.
