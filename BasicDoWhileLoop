/*A while loop checks its condition before the first iteration of the loop. 

A do...while loop checks the condition at the end of the loop. This means there's always at least one iteration of the loop. 

Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer, then gets the input from the user. 

The program should repeatedly ask the user to enter an integer until the user enters an integer greater than 10; then it should print

"Integer greater than 10 detected!" and should end. 

The program must contain only two Write or WriteLine statements! 

Hint: use a do...while loop to enclose the 'prompt' (i.e. the text that prompts the user to enter the integer) and the bit that gets the user input.
